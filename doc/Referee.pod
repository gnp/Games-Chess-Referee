=head1 NAME

Games::Chess::Referee - work with chess positions and games, according to the rules of chess.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::Chess::Referee;
    new_game();
    ply('e2e4');
    ply('e7e5');
    show_board();
    move('d2d3', 'd7d6');
    show_board();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Games::Chess:Referee> module provides a mechanism to interpret (almost) standard algebraic chess notation and to print out the resulting positions. It makes use of the Games::Chess::Position and Games::Chess::Piece classes by Gareth Rees, adding the chess rules and move application functionality.


=head1 ERROR HANDLING

Where the code does complain, it uses the carp routine. The ply() and
move() routines return zero on failure, one on success.


=head1 LIMITATIONS

In this very early version, many of the rules of chess are not yet
implemented. The code is in a state of flux right now, as it is being
reworked into a class from a simple afternoon proof of concept. See
the README file and comments in the code for more information.


=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs as of this writing, but it would be reasonable
to consider the limitations as bugs.
