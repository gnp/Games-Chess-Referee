This is the initial conversion from my first chess-related Perl
program, chess.pl, which provided just enough functionality to
permit tracking the movements of pieces throughout a game. One
notable feature is the ability to provide incomplete ply notation,
allowing the program to figure out, for example, the type of the
piece being moved, or whether the ply represents a capture (x) or
occupation (-).

Future efforts will integrate this with Games::Chess, replacing
the rudimentary board and piece data structures with the better
designed and implemented versions by Gareth Rees, and turning the
Referee itself into an object. It would also be nice to integrate
some of the alternate notation parsing into Games::Chess. Very
abbreviated notation (such as xb4, c5, dxe7, QxR, etc. would be
great, with ambiguity detection).

Also, much more work needs to be done to create a fully functional
referee. Subsequent to that, however, Perl-built chess bots could
be possible, and the referee could be enhanced to the point that
it could be used for on-line chess matches.

Interesting future work would be to wrap the GNU chess engine in
a Perl blanket. This would be most interesting if it was done
in such a way that we weren't just putting a layer over the
terminal interface, but rather, turning the core of the C code
into a Perl-wrapped engine that interfaces with the board via
the Referee.
